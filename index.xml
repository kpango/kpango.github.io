      <description>I have numerous responsibilities regarding the development and system architecture using a wide range of technologies at Yahoo Japanâ€™s SWAT.
My biggest strength is that I&amp;rsquo;m a fast learner and can easily use new technology. Even if I get assigned to a new project and have to use unfamiliar technology, I can take over the leadership of this project in less than one week.
Iâ€™m especially proficient in golang and besides a lot of experience with different programming languages, I also have a profound knowledge starting from infrastructures such as Kubernetes, OpenStack, to vector search engines like NGT.</description>
