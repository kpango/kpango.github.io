      <description>Our team has developed an automatic photo organisation application. It is an application that makes it easier to see the album by analysing the images of the photos, classifying them appropriately, and saving them in the collection. Regarding core functions, we perform machine learning using NGT and vector search and achieve a similar comparison using API.</description>

      <description>I have numerous responsibilities regarding the development and system architecture using a wide range of technologies at Yahoo Japan’s Tech Lab.
My biggest strength is that I&amp;rsquo;m a fast learner and can easily use new technology. Even if I get assigned to a new project and have to use unfamiliar technology, I can take over the leadership of this project in less than one week.
I&amp;rsquo;m exceptionally proficient in golang, and besides much experience with different programming languages, I also have a profound knowledge starting from infrastructures such as Kubernetes, OpenStack, to vector search engines like Vald.</description>
