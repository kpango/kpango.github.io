It was not possible for us to improve CS quality. We cannot analyze CS data across each CS platform. Thus we needed a new CS platform that integrates the full functionality of the current CS system. We were in charge of taking care of CS data security and analytical data structure and data flow.<br>I have many experiences with the cloud environment and security and data analysis, and I provided numerous advice and close support for the platform.</p></li><li><p><em><strong>Service Authorization Mesh Sidecar<br>Chief Architect &amp; Founder (Go/Kubernetes/CloudFoundry/OpenStack)</strong></em>2018/11~2019/7<br>In Yahoo! JAPAN, we use Athenz as an SSoT RBAC source for service authorization and authentication.<br>It was difficult for internal engineers to implement authorization logic using Athenz. In most cases, it took three days to implement, and it was left to the engineers to decide whether to implement Athenz.<br>So, I thought of creating a transparent authorization proxy that operates like ServiceMesh in the cloud environment.<br>I implemented it in a month, and I published it to our internal engineers.<br>As a result, the in-house engineer can deploy the authorization function in 30 minutes, and the mesh sidecar manages the security certificate.<br>It’s an open-source project written in Go.</p></li><li><p><em><strong>Kubernetes as a Service Authorization Platform Garm<br>Engineer &amp; Chief Architect (Go/Kubernetes)</strong></em>2018/4~2018/11<br>I have designed and developed the Kubernetes authorization platform, which is called Garm. Base on the concept of SSoT, Garm can be integrated with Athenz and Kubernetes webhook authorization. This enables a lot of Kubernetes clusters authentication management, and Yahoo! JAPAN currently manages over 450 Kubernetes clusters by using Garm. Garm is now running on all Kubernetes clusters in Yahoo! JAPAN.<br>It’s an open-source project written in Go.</p></li><li><p><em><strong>Approximate Neighborhood Graph Tree Vector Search Engine NGTD/Gongt<br>Engineer &amp; Quality Engineer (Go/C++)</strong></em>2017/10~2018/4<br>I developed a general-purpose dense vector search engine called “NGTD”. Users can register, search, and delete vectors in NGTD via RESTful API and gRPC at the same time, and The user can also quickly search for KNN vectors.<br>It can be used in a wide range of fields such as similar image retrieval and advertisement recommendation in Yahoo!
