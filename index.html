                    <p>I have numerous responsibilities regarding the development and system architecture using a wide range of technologies at Yahoo Japan&rsquo;s Technology Incubation.<br>
My biggest strength is that I&rsquo;m a fast learner and can easily use new technology. Even if I get assigned to a new project and have to use unfamiliar technology, I can take over the leadership of this project in less than one week.<br>
I&rsquo;m exceptionally proficient in golang, and besides much experience with different programming languages, I also have a profound knowledge starting from infrastructures such as Kubernetes, OpenStack, to vector search engines like Vald.</p>

Currently, we work on video analysis &amp; advertisement optimization by image analysis &amp; shopping item recommendation by using image feature vector analysis.</p>

<p><em><strong>Product Owner of Technology Area</strong></em>	2020/4~present<br>

<p><em><strong>Next Generation Vector Search Engine Platform  Vald<br>
Founder &amp; Lead Developer (Go/C++/Python/Kubernetes/OpenStack)</strong></em>	2019/8~present<br>
I&rsquo;m working on the development of distributed approximation KNN graph and tree dense-vector search engine for large-scale vector data. Vald enables the similarity search for Yahoo Japan scale data. We use Vald in the recommendation platform, image search, and video analysis and text search by the vector.<br>
Although we already have the similarity search technology called NGT/ngtd. It only supports running on a single server, and there was a problem that memory and CPU did not scale and was not suitable for distributed cloud environments.<br>
So, for now, I&rsquo;m working on developing a distributed dense vector search engine called Vald (Vektor+Wald in german)</p>

                        <p><p>SWAT is a task force team gathering the most skillful internal engineers. SWAT participates in various projects inside the company to resolve different internal technical problems.<br>
The details of the key projects mentioned below.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em><strong>In-house Centralized Customer Services Platform<br>
Architectural Adviser</strong></em>	2019/6~2019/8<br>
I supported the new In-house centralized customer service platform team as an architectural adviser, and we already have over 200 CS tools in our company. We can not improve CS quality. We can&rsquo;t analyze CS data across each CS platform, so we need a new CS platform that integrates the full functionality of the current cs system. We have to care about CS data security and analytical data structure and data flow.<br>
I have many experiences with the cloud environment and security and data analysis, so I gave much advice about it.</p>

<p><em><strong>Service Authorization Mesh Sidecar<br>
Chief Architect &amp; Founder (Go/Kubernetes/CloudFoundry/OpenStack)</strong></em>	2018/11~2019/7<br>
In Yahoo! JAPAN, we use Athenz as an SSoT RBAC source for service authorization and authentication.<br>
It was difficult for internal engineers to implement authorization logic using Athenz. In most cases, it took three days to implement, and it was left to the engineers to decide whether to implement Athenz.<br>
So, I thought of creating a transparent authorization proxy that operates like ServiceMesh in the cloud environment.<br>
I implemented it in a month, and I published it to our internal engineers.<br>
As a result, the in-house engineer can deploy the authorization function in 30 minutes, and the mesh sidecar manages the security certificate.<br>
It&rsquo;s an open-source project written in golang.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em><strong>Kubernetes as a Service Authorization Platform Garm<br>
Engineer &amp; Chief Architect (Go/Kubernetes)</strong></em>	2018/4~2018/11<br>
I have designed and developed the Kubernetes Authorization Platform, which is called Garm. Base on the concept of SSoT, Garm can be integrated with Athenz and Kubernetes webhook authorization. That enables a lot of Kubernetes clusters authentication management, and Yahoo! JAPAN currently manages over 450 Kubernetes clusters by using Garm. Garm is now running on all Kubernetes clusters in Yahoo! JAPAN.<br>
It&rsquo;s an open-source project written in golang.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em><strong>Approximate Neighborhood Graph Tree Vector Search Engine NGTD/Gongt<br>
Engineer &amp; Quality Engineer (Go/C++)</strong></em>	2017/10~2018/4<br>
I developed a general-purpose dense vector search engine called &ldquo;NGTD&rdquo;. Users can register, search and delete vectors in NGTD via RESTful API and gRPC at the same time, The user can also quickly search for KNN vectors.<br>
It can use in a wide range of fields such as similar image retrieval and advertisement recommendation in Yahoo! JAPAN. NGTD is an open-source project written in golang.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em><strong>Yahoo! JAPAN Online EBook Store<br>
Frontend Engineer (Vue.js/Nuxt.js)</strong></em>	2017/12~2018/2<br>
As a part of a large-scale project regarding E-Book Japan Corporation (a subsidiary of Yahoo! JAPAN). I developed the web frontend of the ebook store, writing in vue.js, based on atomic design.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em><strong>In-house A/B Testing Platform<br>
Engineer &amp; Chief Architect (Go/C++/CloudFoundry)</strong></em>	2017/10~2018/2<br>
I designed and developed a platform for A/B testing which is still used internally by Yahoo! JAPAN today. The server architecture that I designed can withstand a minimum of 80000 req/sec in a microservice architecture.<br>
The software is written in Golang and running on CloudFoundry. The internal algorithm provided a high-speed and flexible A/B testing platform for users using <a href="https://github.com/kpango/murmur3">murmur3</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em><strong>Yahoo! JAPAN Premium Member Advertising Platform<br>
Engineer &amp; Chief Architect (Go/CloudFoundry)</strong></em>	2017/5~2017/7<br>
I have developed and designed an advertising platform for Yahoo! JAPAN&rsquo;s premium members.<br>
In the advertisement distribution, I developed the platform with low-latency and high-speed delivery algorithms. Also, we use a lock-free Concurrent Map for speed. I created the entire architect and microcomponents from scratch..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em><strong>Yahoo! JAPAN Auction<br>
Android Engineer (Kotlin/Java)</strong></em>	2017/3~2017/9<br>
I joined Yahoo! JAPAN&rsquo;s auction team and worked on a large-scale renovation of the Android application. I was responsible for rewriting Java to Kotlin. I made changes to the application, which increased the number of daily active users.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em><strong>Yahoo! JAPAN User Identifier Platform<br>
Backend Engineer (C++)</strong></em>	2017/2~2017/3<br>
In Yahoo! JAPAN&rsquo;s user ID platform, I was in charge of adding the function of a unique cookie algorithm that manages user IDs. The library was written in C ++ and was an old source, so I added a feature with refactoring.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em><strong>Yahoo! JAPAN Mail<br>
Backend Engineer (Java/Hbase/Zookeeper)</strong></em>	2016/4~2017/1<br>
Yahoo! Mail&rsquo;s backend engineering is the first project I joined SWAT.<br>
There, I was developing/localizing the storage layer of the Yahoo! JAPAN Mail platform. At that team, I also worked as a scrum master.</p>
